# GhostLedger

**Payment recovery coordination engine.**
System-assisted recovery for unpaid wages, withheld funds, and platform disputes -- with human oversight at every step.

## What it does

GhostLedger helps surface legitimate recovery cases, reduce noise, and coordinate next steps responsibly.

### Core systems

- **Claim Intake** -- Structured submissions with validation, normalization, and deduplication
- **LITMUS Scoring** -- 6-factor evaluation framework (principles public, implementation private)
- **LICO Decisions** -- Operator review layer (monitor / dismiss / escalate)
- **CCE Classification** -- Multi-dimensional case routing
- **Signal Detection** -- Pattern analysis across respondents and claims
- **Case Groups** -- Automatic grouping of related escalated cases
- **ILF Routing** -- Optional referral to registered professionals
- **Audit Trail** -- Immutable event logging for all system actions

## LITMUS (Public Principles)

Only principles are public; scoring logic, thresholds, and weights are intentionally undisclosed to prevent gaming.

- **L** -- Legitimate Obligation
- **I** -- Independent Verifiability
- **T** -- Tactical Readiness
- **M** -- Material Evidence
- **U** -- Unresolved Harm
- **S** -- Systemic Signal

---

## Doctrine (Boundaries)

- **Detect != Accuse** -- Pattern detection, not judgment
- **Coordinate != Enforce** -- Information routing, not outcomes
- **Route != Represent** -- No legal advice or representation

## Disclaimer

GhostLedger coordinates recovery efforts only. It does not provide legal advice, legal services, or guarantees of recovery. LITMUS supports prioritization and review; it does not replace professional judgment.
